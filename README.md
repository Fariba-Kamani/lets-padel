Visit the deployed site: [Let's Padel](https://fariba-kamani.github.io/lets-padel/)

Let's Padel is a growing community for every one who loves playing padel regardless of gender, age or skill level. As a padel player myself I usually struggle to find other people to play with when I actually have spare time and can play and I beleive I would play more often if I had access to more padel players beyond those whom I know.

#### Future Implementations

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
